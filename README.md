Multivariate analysis of variance of 2 dependent and 2 independent factors (manipulated)
Data
Dependent variables: INFORM , BELIEVE
Independent variables/Factors: GENDER, ADTYPE

Brief overview of project:
This analysis was done on proprietary data, that can't be made public, to see how effect of two factors both manipulated impacts two dependent variables. p-value of Hotelling-Lawley trace was considered to make decisions about significance of effects. 

This code also looks for interaction effects and does follow up or post-hoc tests to determine which two pairs are significantly different.
